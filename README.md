### Background 
I am second year undergraduate student at the Indian Institue of Technology Jodhpur. I am passionate about open source development and really like building real world applications which people can use. I have been contributing to open source for about a year now. Some of my projects which I have worked upon are:
- 1st project
- 2nd Project
- 3rd Project
I am the core member of the open soure community of our college Devlup labs. As a part of this club we build software all round the year for the students of IITJ. I am familiar with version control system and use VS code along with ubuntu as my primary coding environment. 


### Motivation
I am really passionate about open source. I built an app for my college festival using flutter, after which i have also worked on various other flutter projects. AFter working on these college projects I really want to work on something a little more challenging. This project idea is unique, something I have never heard before. Hence this project seems to be the most fun to work on


### Summer Plans
I don't have any prior commitments for this summer. I would be sitting at home for the most part of it. I would be able to commit 40-45 hours per week on this project, however if the project demands more I would definitley be willing to put in more hours.
